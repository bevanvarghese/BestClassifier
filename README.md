# Best Classifier - An Analysis of ML Classification Algorithms

## Abstract
This project applies different ML algorithms for classification and then evaluates the accuracy of these models in predicting whether a loan applicant will pay off the loan or default on the money.

___
## Algorithms Used
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression

___
## Accuracy Metrics Used
1. Jaccard Similarity Score
2. F1-Score
3. LogLoss (for Logistic Regression)

___
