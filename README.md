# Best Classifier - An Analysis of ML Classification Algorithms

### Abstract
This project applies different ML algorithms for classification and then evaluates the accuracy of these models in predicting whether a loan applicant will pay off the loan or default on the money.

### Algorithms Used
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression

### Accuracy Metrics Used
1. Jaccard Similarity Score
2. F1-Score
3. LogLoss (for Logistic Regression

### Results
| Algorithm          | Jaccard | F1-score | LogLoss |
|--------------------|---------|----------|---------|
| KNN                | 0.6667  | 0.6328   | N/A     |
| Decision Tree      | 0.7222  | 0.7367   | N/A     |
| SVM                | 0.7963  | 0.7584   | N/A     |
| LogisticRegression | 0.7407  | 0.6604   | 0.5672  |
